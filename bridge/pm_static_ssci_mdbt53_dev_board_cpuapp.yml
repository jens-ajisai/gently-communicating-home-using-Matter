# By default, the Partition Manager dynamically places the partitions in memory. 
# However, there are cases where a deployed product can consist of multiple images,
# and only a subset of these images can be upgraded through a firmware update mechanism.
# In such cases, the upgradable images must have partitions that are static 
# and are matching the partition map used by the bootloader programmed onto the device.
# For example, if a device includes a non-upgradable first-stage bootloader and an upgradable application,
# the application image to be upgraded must be linked to the same address as the one that is deployed.
# For this purpose, the Partition Manager provides the static configuration to define static partitions.

# Use a static partition layout to ensure consistency between builds, as the settings storage will be at the same location after the DFU.

# Regions are defined in nrf/cmake/partition_manager.cmake

# To use external flash region, define chosen nordic,pm-ext-flash

# The name of the root image is app.
# If the static configuration contains an entry for the app partition, this entry is ignored. ???

# Partition Manager is by default only used for multi image builds. 
#   To use PM for single image builds e.g. to provide a static partition definition,
#   configure CONFIG_PM_SINGLE_IMAGE=y

# The output of the partition manager script is at build/partitions.yml
#   Finally used by the application is build/zephyr/include/generated/pm_config.h

# When using the Partition Manager, run 'ninja partition_manager_report' inside the folder build to see the addresses and sizes of all the configured partitions.
#   Alternative 'west build -t partition_manager_report'
